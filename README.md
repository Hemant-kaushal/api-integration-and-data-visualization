# 5-Day Weather Forecast Visualization

# Project Overview
This project is part of my 2025 Summer Internship Task 1: Weather Data Visualization.

The goal of this project is to fetch real-time weather forecast data from a public API (OpenWeatherMap) and visualize the temperature trends over 5 days. This visualization provides an intuitive way to understand how the temperature fluctuates over time for a specific location.

In this project, I have selected Daltonganj (Jharkhand) as the target city for weather forecasting. The final output is a graphical dashboard saved as an image file named weather_forecast_dashboard.png.



# What the Project Does
Fetches 5-day weather forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap API using Python’s requests library.
Extracts:
Dates and times of forecast
Corresponding temperature values in Celsius.
Creates a line chart showing temperature changes over time using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Saves the visualization as weather_forecast_dashboard.png and also displays it using plt.show().


# Technologies Used
Python 3
Requests – For API calls
Matplotlib & Seaborn – For data visualization


# Output
Input: Data fetched from OpenWeatherMap API for Daltonganj (Jharkhand).
Output: weather_forecast_dashboard.png – A clean line chart showing temperature variation over 5 days.
